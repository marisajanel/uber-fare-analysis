# Uber Fare Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes Uber fare data to identify key pricing trends based on trip distance, duration, and time factors. It also builds regression and decision tree models to predict fares accurately.

## Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle Uber Fares Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/uber-fares-dataset)
- Rows analyzed: ~50,000

## Methods
- Data cleaning and exploration using **pandas**
- Visualizations with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**
- Predictive modeling with **scikit-learn**:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree Regressor
- Model evaluation using R², RMSE, and MAE

## Key Findings
- Shorter trips have higher per-mile costs due to base fare impact
- Decision Tree model outperformed Linear Regression with an R² of X.XX (insert your result)
- Pricing trends varied by pickup time and distance distribution

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Results
This analysis was presented as part of a team project and received an **A+** for thorough data-driven insights and recommendations.

## Repository Structure
- `uber_fare_analysis.ipynb` – main notebook with EDA and modeling
- `images/` – contains output graphs
